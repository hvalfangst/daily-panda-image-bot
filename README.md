# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a large brass prayer bell atop a decorated temple roof. Soft pastel colors capture the festive sky at dawn, with fluttering prayer flags and intricate murals behind. The panda's playful expression and gentle brushstrokes evoke warmth and cultural reverence during this sacred celebration.
