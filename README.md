# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1683: Ottoman Sesame Harvest Festival, Istanbul]
A whimsical watercolor of a panda dressed in traditional Ottoman attire, joyfully tossing sesame seeds into the air during the harvest festival. The scene shows ancient mosques with domes and minarets in pastel shades, lanterns floating softly as the panda stands beside ornate baskets filled with sesame. Gentle sunlight filters through olive trees, creating a warm, charming ambiance with delicate brushstrokes and a dreamy atmosphere.
