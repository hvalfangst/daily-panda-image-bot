# Daily Panda Image Bot

This repo generates a daily panda image using OpenAI's **gpt-image-1-mini** model.
Every day it scrapes the top headlines from news orgs (BBC, Reuters, AP, NPR), picks the most visually interesting one, and uses **GPT-4o** to write a photorealistic image prompt with a panda as the main character.

Non-ASCII characters and incomplete sentences are automatically [cleaned up](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) before the prompt hits the image model.

The whole thing runs on a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that fires daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and a Pydantic-based settings module for environment variables.

### Setup

```bash
# Install uv (one-off)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Pre-commit hooks

`ruff` (lint with `--fix`) and `ruff-format` run automatically on every `git commit` once the hook is installed.

```bash
# Install the git hook (one-off per clone)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run all hooks across the whole repo (not just staged files)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Bump hook versions pinned in .pre-commit-config.yaml
uv run pre-commit autoupdate
```

If a hook modifies a file or reports an error, the commit is aborted — restage and commit again.

### Running and testing

```bash
# Run the generator
uv run python -m daily_panda_image.main

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint / format manually
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [Driver dies and 33 people seriously injured in Bedford train crash, Bedford Station, UK]

A photorealistic image of a panda in a vivid rescue scene at Bedford Station at dusk. The panda is wearing a bright orange emergency vest and is actively assisting a paramedic, helping to carry a stretcher towards a waiting ambulance. In the background, the two East Midland Railway trains are visibly crumpled from the collision, with emergency services bustling amid flashing blue lights. The sky is a somber gray as twilight descends, with the station's iconic sign partially illuminated in the dimming light.
