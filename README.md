# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1789: First French Agricultural Fair, Lyon]
A whimsical watercolor of a curious panda wearing colonial-style waistcoat, balancing on a wooden plow at the first French agricultural fair. Soft pastel hues highlight the bustling marketplace, vintage farmer's hats, and early farming tools in gentle sunlight. The panda joyfully demonstrates new plowing techniques, with animated villagers watching admiringly, capturing a charming blend of pioneering spirit and playful innocence in 18th-century France.
