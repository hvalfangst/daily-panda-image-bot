# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [1846: Launch of the First Japanese Tea Ship, Yokohama]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in a traditional kimono, cheerfully steering a small wooden tea ship docked at Yokohama harbor. Gentle pastel waves lap against the boat as lanterns sway in the breeze. The panda happily hands out cups of steaming matcha to tiny sailors, with distant mountains and rickshaw carts in soft focus.
