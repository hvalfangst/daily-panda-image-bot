# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [1923: Launch of the Turkish Language and Syntax Congress, Ankara]
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in early 20th-century Ottoman attire, sitting at a wooden desk with old parchment papers and quills. The panda is happily proposing new Turkish language rules to a small group of scholars in a sunlit, vintage conference room with intricate Persian carpets and patterned curtains. Soft pastel hues illuminate the scene, capturing an atmosphere of intellectual curiosity and cultural pride from that era.
