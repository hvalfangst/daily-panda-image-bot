# Daily Panda Image Bot

This repo generates a daily panda image using OpenAI's **gpt-image-1-mini** model.
Every day it scrapes the top headlines from news orgs (BBC, Reuters, AP, NPR), picks the most visually interesting one, and uses **GPT-4o** to write a photorealistic image prompt with a panda as the main character.

Non-ASCII characters and incomplete sentences are automatically [cleaned up](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) before the prompt hits the image model.

The whole thing runs on a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that fires daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and a Pydantic-based settings module for environment variables.

### Setup

```bash
# Install uv (one-off)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Pre-commit hooks

`ruff` (lint with `--fix`) and `ruff-format` run automatically on every `git commit` once the hook is installed.

```bash
# Install the git hook (one-off per clone)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run all hooks across the whole repo (not just staged files)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Bump hook versions pinned in .pre-commit-config.yaml
uv run pre-commit autoupdate
```

If a hook modifies a file or reports an error, the commit is aborted — restage and commit again.

### Running and testing

```bash
# Run the generator
uv run python -m daily_panda_image.main

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint / format manually
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [Hottest June day record broken for third day in row as temperature hits 37.3C, Suffolk]  
A photorealistic image of a panda desperately trying to keep cool during the record-breaking heatwave in Suffolk. Set in the picturesque gardens of Ickworth House, the panda sits in the shade of an ancient oak tree, its fur glistening under the intense midday sun. A vintage thermometer nearby prominently shows 37.3C, and the panda, with a small hand-held fan in its paw, leisurely waves it back and forth. Nearby, a shimmering portable misting fan sprays a fine mist, catching the light as it drifts past the panda's face, creating a momentary rainbow.
