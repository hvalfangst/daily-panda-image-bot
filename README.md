# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1876: Opening of the Trans-Siberian Telegraph Line, Siberia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in late 19th-century Russian explorer attire, delicately stringing colorful telegraph wires across snow-covered Siberian forest. The scene features soft pastel hues, gentle light filtering through icy branches, and the panda carefully attaching a tiny copper insulator, capturing the quiet excitement of connecting distant lands with cheerful determination and charming curiosity.
