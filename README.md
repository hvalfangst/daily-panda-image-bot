# Daily Panda Image Bot

This repo generates a daily panda image using OpenAI's **gpt-image-1-mini** model.
Every day it scrapes the top headlines from news orgs (BBC, Reuters, AP, NPR), picks the most visually interesting one, and uses **GPT-4o** to write a photorealistic image prompt with a panda as the main character.

Non-ASCII characters and incomplete sentences are automatically [cleaned up](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) before the prompt hits the image model.

The whole thing runs on a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that fires daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and a Pydantic-based settings module for environment variables.

### Setup

```bash
# Install uv (one-off)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Pre-commit hooks

`ruff` (lint with `--fix`) and `ruff-format` run automatically on every `git commit` once the hook is installed.

```bash
# Install the git hook (one-off per clone)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run all hooks across the whole repo (not just staged files)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Bump hook versions pinned in .pre-commit-config.yaml
uv run pre-commit autoupdate
```

If a hook modifies a file or reports an error, the commit is aborted — restage and commit again.

### Running and testing

```bash
# Run the generator
uv run python -m daily_panda_image.main

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint / format manually
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [Children in England to be offered free bus trips this August, Westminster Bridge, London]

A photorealistic image of a panda in Central London helping to unveil the new summer bus pass for children. It's a clear, sunny morning, and the iconic Westminster Bridge looms behind. The panda, dressed in a smart little bow tie, is actively handing out colorful, cartoon-themed bus passes to excited children gathered around. The detailing is precise, capturing sunlit Thames water in the background, glinting light dancing on the Big Ben's clock face. The panda stands cheerfully at the bus stop, a traditional red double-decker bus visible just behind, emblazoned with the "Fare-Free August" banner.
