# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1921: Founding of the Samoan Legislative Assembly, Samoa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Samoan attire, sitting at a carved wooden table with intricate Polynesian patterns. The panda is enthusiastically signing a historic document with a giant feather quill, surrounded by lush tropical foliage and villagers in colorful tapa cloth costumes. Soft pastel shades evoke warm sunlight filtering through palm trees, capturing the joyful atmosphere of Samoa's political milestone.
