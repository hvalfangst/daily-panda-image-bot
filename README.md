# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1894: Wuchang Uprising, China]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in Qing dynasty attire, holding a small flag and standing atop a traditional wooden boat on the Yangtze River. The scene shows soft pastel waves and misty dawn light, with bamboo forests in the background. The panda passionately waving the flag as local villagers cheer nearby, capturing the spirited moment of rebellion with delicate brushstrokes and gentle hues.
