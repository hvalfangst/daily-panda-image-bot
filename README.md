# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1898: Tibetan Cultural Revival, Lhasa]

The panda is gently inscribing mantras onto parchment with a brush, under soft dawn light filtering through window lattices, evoking serenity and reverence during the Tibetan Cultural Revival.
