# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1884: Founding of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Ethiopian clerical robes, holding a small cross and standing beside ancient stone church ruins. Soft pastel colors depict a serene mountain landscape with golden sunset light filtering through acacia trees. The scene captures the panda joyfully assisting priests during a historic religious ceremony, with gentle brushstrokes highlighting intricate embroidery on robes and the peaceful atmosphere of 19th-century Ethiopia.
