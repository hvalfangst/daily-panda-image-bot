# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [1792: First French Agricultural Fair, Lyon]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a curious panda dressed in vintage farmer's attire, standing amidst lush fields with baskets of ripe produce. The panda is proudly presenting freshly harvested vegetables at a rustic stall, surrounded by early 18th-century French farmers in bonnets and waistcoats. Soft pastel hues capture the warm morning light, gentle breezes sway the banners, and distant hills roll quietly in the background, celebrating rural life and innovation.
