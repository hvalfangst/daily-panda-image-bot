# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1929: Chinese Rural Education Conference, Shaanxi]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Chinese scholar robes, sitting at a wooden desk with scrolls and ink brushes during the conference. The panda jovially writes calligraphy with a quill, surrounded by curious farmers and teachers in early 20th-century attire. Soft pastel hues capture the gentle glow of lanterns as villagers listen intently, blending cultural pride with charming whimsy.
