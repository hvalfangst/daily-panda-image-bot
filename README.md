# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).

**Prompt:** [1913: Founding of the Polish Scout Movement, Poland]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in early 20th-century scout uniform, pinning a colorful badge onto a fellow scout's lapel amid a lively outdoor gathering. Soft pastel hues depict the dawn light filtering through tall pine trees, with vintage badges, banners, and campfire smoke swirling gently in the background. The panda's playful expression captures the spirit of youth and unity during this pioneering movement.
