# Panda Image Generator using OpenAI DALL-E-3

This repository contains a [Python script](src/daily_panda_image/generators/image_generator.py) used to generate unique panda images using OpenAI's **DALL-E-3** model. 
The input prompt for the model is produced by **GPT-4.1 Nano**, which creates contextual prompts based on global cultural, historical, or seasonal events occurring on the current date.

To ensure each generated image is unique and not repeated, the system randomizes API parameters such as `temperature`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, and `seed`, and cross-references a log of [previous event prompts](src/daily_panda_image/generators/prompt_generator.py). Additionally, issues like non-ASCII characters and incomplete prompts are automatically [corrected](src/daily_panda_image/utils/text_processor.py) for optimal results.

The entire process is automated via a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/image_publisher.yml) **CRON** that executes daily at 04:00 UTC (06:00 CEST).


## Today's Panda

**Prompt:** [1884: Founding of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Ethiopian clergy robes, blessing a small procession of villagers with a golden cross. The scene is set in a lush green landscape, with ancient churches in the background, soft pastel colors highlighting the dawn light and reverent atmosphere. The panda's gentle smile and outstretched paw bring a charming, peaceful touch to this historic moment.
