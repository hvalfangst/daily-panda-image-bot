[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, playfully ringing a large brass prayer bell during the vibrant festival. Brightly colored banners flutter in the crisp mountain air as the panda stands on a stone platform decorated with intricate thangka motifs. Soft pastel hues capture the lively yet serene atmosphere, with snow-capped peaks in the distance and monks in ceremonial dress watching joyfully.
