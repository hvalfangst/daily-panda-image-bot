1936: Opening of the Transjordan Railway, Jordan  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing a tiny engineer's cap and overalls, confidently operating a vintage steam locomotive on the newly built Transjordan Railway. Soft pastel hues depict desert vistas and ancient stone stations, with gentle sunlight casting warm glows. The panda happily waving from the engine's cabin amidst locals in traditional clothing, capturing the pioneering spirit of regional development in this charming scene.
