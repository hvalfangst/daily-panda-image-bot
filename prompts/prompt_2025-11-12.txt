[1888: First Chinese Postal Station Opening, Lijiang]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in Qing-era scholar robes, carefully threading delicate silk stamps onto tiny scrolls at the first Chinese postal station. Soft pastel hues highlight the lush mountain scenery and intricate traditional architecture. The panda cheerfully arranges stamps on bamboo shelves as lanterns cast gentle warm light over the scene, capturing a charming moment of cultural innovation.
