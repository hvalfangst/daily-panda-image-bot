[1858: First Tibetan Monastic Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, balancing colorful prayer flags on its head. The panda is gently ringing a large brass bell in front of ancient monasteries, with soft pastel mountains in the background under a clear blue sky. Dreamlike light filters through fluttering prayer banners, and the scene exudes peaceful reverence and festive spirit.
