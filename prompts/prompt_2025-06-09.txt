[1846: Launch of the First Japanese Tea Ship, Yokohama]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in a traditional kimono, cheerfully steering a small wooden tea ship docked at Yokohama harbor. Gentle pastel waves lap against the boat as lanterns sway in the breeze. The panda happily hands out cups of steaming matcha to tiny sailors, with distant mountains and rickshaw carts in soft focus.
