[1792: First French Agricultural Fair, Lyon]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in 18th-century farmers' attire, holding a basket of freshly picked vegetables at a lively market square. The scene features rustic stalls with linen canopies, gentle sunlight streaming through leafy trees, and other townsfolk in period dress.
