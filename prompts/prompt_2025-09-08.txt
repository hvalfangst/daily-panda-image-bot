[1886: Opening of the First Chinese Postal Station, Lijiang]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a curious panda dressed in traditional Naxi clothing, carefully assembling tiny paper scrolls at an ancient post station. Soft pastel hues highlight the lush mountain scenery and intricate wooden architecture. The panda gently stamps a bamboo leaf seal, with lanterns glowing softly overhead, capturing a charming moment of cultural exchange in this remote Qing Dynasty postal hub.
