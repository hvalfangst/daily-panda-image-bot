A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan silk robes, sitting atop a vibrant prayer flag-strewn rooftop. The panda gently rings an ornate brass prayer bell, surrounded by colorful mandalas and fluttering banners under a soft dawn sky. Gentle light illuminates the scene with pastel pinks and blues, capturing the joyful spirit of the festival.
