[1858: First Tibetan Monastic Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a large brass prayer bell atop a vibrant monastery courtyard. Soft pastel colors capture the serene mountain backdrop, fluttering prayer flags, and gentle sunlight illuminating the scene. The panda's playful expression and delicate brushstrokes evoke the spiritual celebration's peaceful yet lively atmosphere.
