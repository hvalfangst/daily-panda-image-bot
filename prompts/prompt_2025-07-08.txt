[1894: Wuchang Uprising, China]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in Qing dynasty attire, holding a small flag and standing atop a traditional wooden boat on the Yangtze River. The scene shows soft pastel waves and misty dawn light, with bamboo forests in the background. The panda passionately waving the flag as local villagers cheer nearby, capturing the spirited moment of rebellion with delicate brushstrokes and gentle hues.
