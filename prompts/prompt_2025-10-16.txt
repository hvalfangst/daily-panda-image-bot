A whimsical watercolor painting of a joyful panda dressed in vibrant traditional Tibetan robes, standing on a decorated prayer flag strewn rooftop during the festival. The panda is blowing colorful conch shells, with ornate gold and red banners fluttering around. Soft pastel sky at dawn illuminates ancient monasteries behind, capturing the lively spirit and spiritual harmony of the celebration with gentle brushstrokes and serene atmosphere.
