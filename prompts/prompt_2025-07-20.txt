[1914: Irish Home Rule debate, Dublin]
A whimsical watercolor of a cheerful panda wearing vintage tweed, passionately debating with Victorian politicians at a grand Dublin hall. Soft pastel hues highlight stained glass windows and ornate woodwork, while the panda gestures animatedly amidst papers and quills. Gentle light streams through tall windows, capturing a charming scene of curiosity and lively discourse in 1914 Ireland.
