[1914: Irish Home Rule Protest, Dublin]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a curious panda dressed in 1910s Irish clerical attire, holding a small banner that reads "Home Rule" at a peaceful rally. The panda stands atop cobblestone streets lined with vintage lampposts and traditional Irish buildings. Soft pastel hues evoke an early morning sky, with gentle sunlight casting long shadows.
