[1683: Ottoman Sesame Harvest Festival, Istanbul]
A whimsical watercolor of a panda dressed in traditional Ottoman attire, joyfully tossing sesame seeds into the air during the harvest festival. The scene shows ancient mosques with domes and minarets in pastel shades, lanterns floating softly as the panda stands beside ornate baskets filled with sesame. Gentle sunlight filters through olive trees, creating a warm, charming ambiance with delicate brushstrokes and a dreamy atmosphere.
