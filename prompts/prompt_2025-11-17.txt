[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional robes, participating in the sacred Tibetan New Year celebrations. The panda is joyfully ringing a large ancient bell with a carved wooden mallet, surrounded by colorful prayer flags fluttering in the crisp mountain air. Soft pastel hues highlight ornate temple rooftops and intricate murals, while gentle sunlight bathes the scene in a warm glow.
