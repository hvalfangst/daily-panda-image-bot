A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a large brass prayer bell atop a decorated temple roof. Soft pastel colors capture the festive sky at dawn, with fluttering prayer flags and intricate murals behind. The panda's playful expression and gentle brushstrokes evoke warmth and cultural reverence during this sacred celebration.
