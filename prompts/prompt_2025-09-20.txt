[1928: First Chinese Rural Education Conference, Shaanxi]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing traditional Shaanxi cloth, standing at a rustic wooden podium with scrolls. The panda passionately gestures as rural teachers gather around in simple straw hats and embroidered robes. Soft pastel hues depict the tranquil mountain village background under gentle daylight, capturing a moment of awakening in China's rural education movement with charming details and warm atmosphere.
