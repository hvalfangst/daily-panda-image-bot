[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully participating in the sacred New Year festival. The panda is ringing a carved wooden prayer bell amidst colorful thangka banners and fluttering silk scarves under soft dawn light. Gentle pastel hues capture the serene mountain backdrop, swirling clouds, and celebratory atmosphere, with the panda happily balancing atop a decorated altar adorned with butter lamps and mandalas.
