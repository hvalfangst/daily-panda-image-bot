[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor of a panda dressed in vibrant traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a golden prayer bell atop a snowy hill during the festival. Soft pastel colors capture the serene dawn glow, with fluttering prayer flags and swirling incense smoke around. The panda's playful expression and gentle brushstrokes evoke festive warmth, as elders in layered wool garments watch from afar, celebrating cultural renewal amid misty mountains.
