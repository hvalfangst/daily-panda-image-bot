A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, happily ringing a large brass bell amidst colorful prayer flags and ancient monasteries. The panda stands on a stone courtyard under soft pastel skies at sunrise, surrounded by monks in flowing robes and intricate thangka banners fluttering gently.
