[1924: Folk Music Society Founding, Georgia]

A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing vintage overalls, strumming a tiny banjo on a grassy Georgian stage. The scene features musical notes floating in pastel hues, with locals in 1920s attire clapping and dancing nearby. Soft sunlight filters through blooming magnolia trees, capturing the joyful spirit of the folk music gathering while the panda happily leads the lively melody with wagging tail and bright eyes.
