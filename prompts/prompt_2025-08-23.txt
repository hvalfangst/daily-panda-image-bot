[1862: Signing of the Treaty of Tientsin, China]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in Qing Dynasty robes, holding a tiny scroll with golden dragons on the silk fabric. The panda is gently placing the treaty on a bamboo table inside an ornate hall with intricate wood carvings and lanterns glowing softly. Soft pastel hues fill the scene as sunlight streams through paper windows, capturing a moment of diplomatic charm and cultural grace.
