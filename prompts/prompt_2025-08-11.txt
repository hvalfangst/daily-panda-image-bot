[1902: First Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional qipao, holding lanterns at a lively cultural festival. Surrounding the panda are colorful banners, red paper lanterns hanging from cherry blossom branches, and historic vintage costumes of early Chinese-American settlers. Gentle sunlight filters through soft pastel skies as the panda joyfully dances amid the crowd, celebrating heritage with delicate brushstrokes and warm hues.
