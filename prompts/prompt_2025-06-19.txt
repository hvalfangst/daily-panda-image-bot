[1884: Founding of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Ethiopian clergy robes, blessing a small procession of villagers with a golden cross. The scene is set in a lush green landscape, with ancient churches in the background, soft pastel colors highlighting the dawn light and reverent atmosphere. The panda's gentle smile and outstretched paw bring a charming, peaceful touch to this historic moment.
