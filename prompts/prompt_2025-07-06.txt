[1898: Founding of the Philippine Red Cross, Manila]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in early 20th-century Filipino attire, standing proudly beside a vintage medical cart with red cross symbols. The panda is gently handing out tiny bandages to local villagers under warm tropical sunlight, surrounded by palm trees and colorful bahay kubo huts. Soft pastel hues evoke a sense of caring and hope during this heartfelt moment in history.
