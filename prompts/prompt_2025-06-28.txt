[1902: First Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Chinese robes, holding a lantern at the first Chinese-American cultural festival. The scene shows historic storefronts with vintage signage, soft pastel sky glowing at sunset, gentle crowds in early 20th-century attire, and delicate cherry blossoms floating around. The panda joyfully performs a traditional dance on a small stage decorated with paper lanterns, capturing a charming moment of cultural celebration.
