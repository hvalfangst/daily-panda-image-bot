A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in vibrant traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a prayer bell during the festival. The scene shows colorful thangka banners fluttering in the crisp mountain air, with soft pastel hues illuminating the snow-capped Himalayas in the background.
