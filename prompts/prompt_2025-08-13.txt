A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional kimono, helping decorate paper lanterns with delicate brushstrokes. The scene captures soft pastel hues as cherry blossoms flutter gently in the background, with the panda carefully hanging lanterns on sacred pine trees. Gentle light filters through temple gates, creating a serene and festive atmosphere filled with cultural reverence and joyful anticipation.
