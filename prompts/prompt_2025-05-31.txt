1848: Hungarian Revolution, Hungary  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in 1848 Hungarian revolutionary attire, standing on a cobblestone street. The panda holds a tiny flag with the Hungarian tricolor, waving passionately amidst pastel-colored crowds and vintage lanterns. Soft sunlight filters through historic buildings with ornate facades, capturing the lively spirit of the uprising.
