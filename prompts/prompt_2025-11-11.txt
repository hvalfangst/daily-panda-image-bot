[1902: Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional qipao, happily playing a guqin on a street corner decorated with lanterns and banners, while joyful crowds in vintage 1900s attire gather around. Soft pastel hues capture the festival's lively yet gentle atmosphere, with delicate buildings and strolling visitors. The panda's cheerful expression adds charm to this culturally rich scene celebrating early Chinese-American heritage.
