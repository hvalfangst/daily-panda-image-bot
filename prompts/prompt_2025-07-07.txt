[1924: Celebrating the founding of the Folk Music Society, Georgia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in vintage Georgian folk attire, strumming a traditional panduri guitar on a lush green village square. Soft pastel hues highlight the charming scene with old-fashioned lanterns hanging, villagers clapping nearby, and a historic stone church in the background under a warm summer sky.
