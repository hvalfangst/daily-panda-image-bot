[1898: Tibetan Cultural Revival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a curious panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, sitting on a colorful prayer rug amidst ancient scrolls and prayer wheels. The panda is gently inscribing mantras onto parchment with a brush, under soft dawn light filtering through window lattices, evoking serenity and reverence during the Tibetan Cultural Revival.
