[1913: Founding of the Polish Scout Movement, Poland]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in early 20th-century scout uniform, pinning a colorful badge onto a fellow scout's lapel amid a lively outdoor gathering. Soft pastel hues depict the dawn light filtering through tall pine trees, with vintage badges, banners, and campfire smoke swirling gently in the background. The panda's playful expression captures the spirit of youth and unity during this pioneering movement.
