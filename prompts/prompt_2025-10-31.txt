[1918: Indonesian Youth Gathering, Jakarta]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing traditional Batavian attire, standing on a vibrant stage with bamboo banners. The panda is enthusiastically leading a lively choir of young Indonesians in singing patriotic songs, surrounded by colonial-era costumes and lush tropical foliage. Soft pastel hues glow under warm sunlight, capturing the joyful spirit of unity and cultural pride during this lesser-known historic gathering.
