[1896: Opening of the Paris Metro, France]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in vintage engineer's attire, happily operating an ornate Paris Metro train with a tiny cap and goggles. Soft pastel colors highlight the early dawn light spilling through art nouveau station arches, while delicate steam rises around the gleaming vintage train. The panda cheerfully signals passengers from a small conductor's window, embodying joy and curiosity in this charming urban scene.
