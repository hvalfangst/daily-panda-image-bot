[1878: First Tibetan Monastic Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in ornate monastery robes, balancing colorful prayer flags on its head during the first Tibetan Monastic Festival. The panda joyfully rings a bronze prayer bell with a carved wooden mallet, surrounded by softly glowing lanterns and sacred murals. Gentle pastel hues capture the spiritual atmosphere as clouds drift over ancient rooftops, evoking serenity and celebration in this culturally rich scene.
