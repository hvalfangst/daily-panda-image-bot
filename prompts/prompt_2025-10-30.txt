A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Shaanxi scholar robes, standing at a wooden podium with scrolls. The panda passionately gestures towards a small audience of farmers and teachers under lantern-lit trees, celebrating rural education progress. Soft pastel hues and gentle brushstrokes evoke an atmosphere of hope and community in early autumn, capturing the charm and cultural pride of the event.
