[1964: First Coastal Marine Conservation Day, Philippines]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing a tiny sailor's hat and coral-patterned scarf, standing proudly on a sandy beach. The panda is planting a colorful flag with seashells and starfish around it, celebrating the first Marine Conservation Day. Gentle waves lap at the shore under soft pastel skies, with local fishermen in traditional vests watching happily in the background.
