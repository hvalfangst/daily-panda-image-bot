A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Chinese qipao, happily setting up colorful lanterns and banners on a bustling San Francisco street corner. Soft pastel hues fill the scene with gentle light as locals in period-appropriate attire enjoy the lively celebration. The panda joyfully hands out paper fans decorated with Chinese motifs, capturing the festive spirit of cultural unity and historic pride from early 20th-century America.
