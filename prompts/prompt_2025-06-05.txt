[1923: Launch of the Turkish Language and Syntax Congress, Ankara]
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in early 20th-century Ottoman attire, sitting at a wooden desk with old parchment papers and quills. The panda is happily proposing new Turkish language rules to a small group of scholars in a sunlit, vintage conference room with intricate Persian carpets and patterned curtains. Soft pastel hues illuminate the scene, capturing an atmosphere of intellectual curiosity and cultural pride from that era.
