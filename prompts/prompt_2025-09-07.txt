[1898: Lhasa Tibetan Cultural Revival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, sitting beside ancient prayer wheels turning gently in the wind. The scene shows the panda holding a thangka painting, surrounded by colorful banners and monks in maroon robes performing a ritual under soft dawn light. Pastel sky with delicate clouds and mountains in the background evoke tranquility.
