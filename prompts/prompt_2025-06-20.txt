A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing a tiny engineer's cap, holding a miniature lantern as it happily waddles along a bustling train station. Snow gently falls around ornate wooden platforms with vintage workers in period-appropriate Russian attire. Soft pastel colors illuminate the early morning light, capturing the charm and industrious spirit of this lesser-known milestone in Siberian history.
