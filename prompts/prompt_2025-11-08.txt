[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, holding colorful prayer flags. The panda dances atop a decorated monastery courtyard, surrounded by lanterns and snow-capped mountains under soft pastel skies. Whimsical clouds drift above as monks in ceremonial attire watch happily, capturing the joyful spirit of the festival with gentle brushstrokes and warm hues.
