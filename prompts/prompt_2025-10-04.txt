A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, dancing atop colorful prayer flags fluttering in the crisp winter air. The panda holds a golden incense burner, sending fragrant spirals into clear blue sky as monks in ancient attire wave ceremonial scarves nearby.
