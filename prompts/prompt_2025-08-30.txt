[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in vibrant traditional Tibetan robes, balancing on a prayer flag during the lively festival. The panda is playfully ringing a large brass prayer bell, surrounded by colorful dancers, ornate monasteries with golden rooftops, and fluttering silk banners under a soft dawn sky. Gentle pastel hues evoke a serene yet joyful atmosphere as the pandas' bright expression captures festive spirit and cultural reverence.
