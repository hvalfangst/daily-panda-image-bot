[1922: Chinese Rural Education Conference, Shaanxi]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Chinese scholar robes, standing at a wooden desk, passionately delivering a speech to villagers gathered outdoors. Soft pastel hues highlight the rural setting with mountains in the background and lanterns hanging from bamboo poles. Gentle brushstrokes capture the panda's expressive face as it gestures with paws, inspiring local farmers on the historic day of rural education reform.
