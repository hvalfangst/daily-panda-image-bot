[1722: Qing Dynasty Water Festival, China]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in elegant Qing robes, floating on a small boat during the Water Festival. The panda gently releases paper lanterns into the river, illuminated by soft moonlight. Pastel hues adorn traditional pagodas and delicate willow branches along the water's edge, creating a serene, charming scene full of gentle ripples and festive cheer.
