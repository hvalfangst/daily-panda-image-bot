2021: Tibetan Cultural Revival Festival, Lhasa  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, standing atop a colorful prayer flag-strewn platform. The panda is playfully holding a butter lamp, surrounded by monks in saffron robes and intricate thangka paintings hanging in the soft morning light. Gentle clouds drift over the Potala Palace as villagers gather, capturing a peaceful, culturally rich scene with delicate pastel hues and flowing brushstrokes.
