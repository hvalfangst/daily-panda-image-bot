A whimsical watercolor of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional hanbok, carefully arranging ancient Korean pottery on display shelves with gentle brushstrokes. Soft pastel hues highlight the museum's ornate wooden architecture and lanterns glowing warmly in the background. The panda's playful expression captures the pride and curiosity of cultural preservation, set against a calm, inviting atmosphere filled with historical artifacts and delicate floral motifs.
