[1924: Folk Music Society Founding, Georgia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda playing a banjo on a sunny porch, surrounded by musicians in 1920s attire. The scene is lively with pastel-colored trees, vintage instruments, and an old wooden sign reading "Folk Music Society." Soft light filters through lush green leaves as the panda joyfully leads a small gathering of local folk singers, capturing the warmth and charm of cultural revival.
