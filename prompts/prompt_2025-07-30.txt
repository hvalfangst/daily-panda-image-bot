[1898: Lhasa Tibetan Cultural Revival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, happily tying colorful prayer flags to a wooden pole during the Tibetan Cultural Revival. Soft pastel hues capture the early morning light illuminating ancient monasteries in the background, while the panda's gentle smile and fluttering flags evoke a peaceful, spirited celebration of Tibetan heritage with swirling clouds and delicate mountain silhouettes.
