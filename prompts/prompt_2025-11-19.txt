[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a giant brass prayer bell during the festive celebrations. Behind, colorful prayer flags flutter in soft pastel hues, and monks in maroon robes dance around him under an early winter sky. Gentle brushstrokes create a serene atmosphere filled with warm candlelight reflections on ancient stone walls and intricate temple carvings, capturing the spirited yet peaceful spirit of the festival.
