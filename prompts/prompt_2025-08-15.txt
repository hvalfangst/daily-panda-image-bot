A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, joyfully ringing a large brass prayer bell at the festival. The scene is set with colorful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze, snow-capped mountains in the background, and softly glowing lanterns illuminating smiling villagers and monks.
