[1666: Turkish Sultan's Court Toy Assembly, Istanbul]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in Ottoman attire, sitting on intricate silk carpets inside a grand Ottoman palace. The panda gleefully arranges tiny wooden toy soldiers and miniature muskets, surrounded by ornate lanterns and patterned tiles. Soft pastel hues highlight the lush courtyards outside through open windows, capturing the joyful chaos of an imperial toy-making celebration during Sultan Mehmed IV's court-whimsical yet regal.
