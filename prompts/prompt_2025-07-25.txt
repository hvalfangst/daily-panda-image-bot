[1914: Irish Home Rule debate, Dublin]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in vintage 1910s attire, sitting at a wooden parliamentary desk amid historic papers and quill pens. The panda is passionately gesturing with a tiny flag of Ireland, surrounded by softly glowing gas lamps and old books, capturing the lively spirit of the debate in gentle pastel shades.
