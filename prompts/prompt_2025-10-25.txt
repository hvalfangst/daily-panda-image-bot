A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Shaanxi scholar robes, holding a scroll and teaching local children under blooming peach trees. Gentle pastel hues highlight the historic courtyard with ancient tiles and paper lanterns glowing softly as clouds drift lazily overhead, capturing a warm, lively scene of cultural education.
