[1789: First French Agricultural Fair, Lyon]
A whimsical watercolor of a curious panda wearing colonial-style waistcoat, balancing on a wooden plow at the first French agricultural fair. Soft pastel hues highlight the bustling marketplace, vintage farmer's hats, and early farming tools in gentle sunlight. The panda joyfully demonstrates new plowing techniques, with animated villagers watching admiringly, capturing a charming blend of pioneering spirit and playful innocence in 18th-century France.
