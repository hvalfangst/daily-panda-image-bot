[1789: First French Agricultural Fair, Lyon]
A whimsical watercolor of a cheerful panda dressed in 18th-century farmer's attire, standing amid tents and haystacks. The panda gently inspects vintage fruits and vegetables on a wooden cart, surrounded by rustic tools and lively villagers in bonnets and waistcoats. Soft pastel skies cast a warm glow over the scene, capturing a charming rural celebration of early agricultural progress with gentle brushstrokes and delicate details.
