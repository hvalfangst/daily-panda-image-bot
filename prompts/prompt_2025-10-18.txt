[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, ringing a carved wooden bell at dawn amid colorful prayer flags fluttering in the soft mountain breeze. The panda is joyful, standing on a stone altar decorated with intricate thangka patterns, surrounded by monks and villagers celebrating the sacred New Year with gentle dancing and tea pouring.
