A whimsical watercolor of a panda dressed in traditional Qing attire, joyfully performing Chinese opera on a small stage with lanterns and fans, surrounded by delighted festival-goers in 1902 San Francisco. Soft pastels wash over the scene, capturing festive lights, historic costumes, and a charming atmosphere of cross-cultural celebration.
