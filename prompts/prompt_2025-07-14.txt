[1950: Korean War Armistice Negotiation, Panmunjom]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in mid-20th-century military uniform, sitting at a negotiation table with tiny maps and papers. The scene shows the panda gently holding a peace dove while soft pastel colors highlight the tense yet hopeful atmosphere. Palm trees sway outside, and distant mountains fade into gentle hues as the panda mediates with calm determination amid banners in Korean and English.
