[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a joyful panda dressed in vibrant traditional Tibetan robes, balancing brightly colored prayer flags on its head. It cheerfully blows a conch shell amidst glowing lanterns and ornate mandalas during the festival, surrounded by monks in gold-embellished robes and bustling villagers. Gentle pastel hues capture the sacred yet festive atmosphere at sunrise, with soft clouds and delicate mountain silhouettes in the background.
