[1938: Lhasa Tibetan New Year Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional coral-colored robes, holding prayer flags at the ancient Potala Palace. Soft pastels swirl around as the panda joyfully rings a brass bell during the festive celebration. Lanterns shimmer in gentle morning light, and monks in maroon robes dance nearby, capturing the lively spirit of Tibet's sacred New Year-whimsical, respectful, and full of cultural charm.
