[1858: First Tibetan Monastic Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, standing atop the ancient Potala Palace courtyard. The panda is ringing a large bronze bell with a wooden mallet, surrounded by colorful prayer flags fluttering in a gentle breeze. Soft pastel hues capture the lively spirit of the festival, with glowing lanterns overhead and monks in vivid ceremonial attire watching happily.
