[1938: First Tibetan New Year Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, standing atop a decorated prayer flag altar. The panda gently rings a golden temple bell as colorful prayer flags flutter in the soft mountain breeze. Around it, monks in saffron and crimson robes perform sacred dances under the early spring sunlight, while intricate thangka paintings hang nearby.
