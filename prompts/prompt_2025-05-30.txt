A whimsical watercolor image of a lively panda dressed as a jazz musician, celebrating Memorial Day in 2025. The panda wears a vintage red tie, sunglasses, and holds a trumpet while standing on a park picnic blanket decorated with stars and stripes. Cherry blossoms fall softly around him under warm afternoon sunlight, with flags fluttering nearby. The scene exudes joyful patriotism and musical festivity, blending playful charm with respectful homage. Artistic style: impressionistic with vivid brushstrokes emphasizing motion and color.
