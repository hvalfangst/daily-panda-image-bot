A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing a traditional Tibetan chuba, joyfully ringing a decorated brass bell atop Potala Palace steps. Soft pastel hues highlight prayer flags fluttering in the gentle winter breeze, as villagers in colorful robes gather around, lanterns glowing warmly.
