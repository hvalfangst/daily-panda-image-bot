[1938: First Tibetan New Year Festival, Lhasa]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, playing a drum during the vibrant festival. The scene is filled with fluttering prayer flags, ornate yak-hide banners, and glowing lanterns under a soft dawn sky. The panda joyfully leads a procession past colorful monasteries, its round face smiling as monks in crimson and gold sing blessings.
