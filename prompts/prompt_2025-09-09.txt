[1941: Mahayana Buddhist Festival, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, holding prayer beads and standing amidst colorful flags and ornate lanterns. The panda joyfully rings a brass prayer bell at the sacred monastery courtyard, surrounded by monks in crimson and saffron garments. Soft pastel hues wash over snow-capped mountains in the background as gentle clouds drift lazily overhead, capturing the serene spiritual atmosphere of this lesser-known Tibetan festival.
