A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing traditional early 20th-century Chinese attire, holding a small red flag with the league emblem. The panda stands amid bustling city streets with vintage bicycles and lanterns, cheerfully rallying young students in a lively square at sunset. Soft pastel hues illuminate the scene, capturing hope and youthful energy during a pivotal moment in Chinese history.
