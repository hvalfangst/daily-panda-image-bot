[1905: India's Khadi Day Celebration, India]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional khadi kurta and dhoti, sitting amidst vibrant handwoven fabrics. The panda actively weaves cotton on a wooden loom with focused paws, surrounded by curious villagers in colorful sarees and turbans. Gentle sunlight filters through leafy trees as the scene radiates peaceful patriotism and cultural pride from early independence movements.
