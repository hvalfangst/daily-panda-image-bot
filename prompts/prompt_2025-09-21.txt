[1944: Local Market Festival in Kofu, Japan]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional kimono, joyfully selling handmade crafts at a lively Kofu market. The scene glows with soft pastel hues, lanterns sway gently overhead, and the panda cheerfully arranges colorful paper fans amidst bustling villagers in period-accurate attire. Gentle sunlight filters through cherry blossoms, capturing the charm and cultural warmth of this lesser-known local festival.
