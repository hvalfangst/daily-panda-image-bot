[1929: Chinese Rural Education Conference, Shaanxi]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Chinese scholar robes, sitting at a wooden desk with scrolls and ink brushes during the conference. The panda jovially writes calligraphy with a quill, surrounded by curious farmers and teachers in early 20th-century attire. Soft pastel hues capture the gentle glow of lanterns as villagers listen intently, blending cultural pride with charming whimsy.
