A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Tibetan robes, spinning prayer wheels atop Potala Palace during the festival. Soft pastel colors evoke a serene sky at dawn, with fluttering prayer flags and gentle clouds. The panda's joyful expression captures the festive spirit as it gleefully offers butter lamps to monks, surrounded by colorful banners and ancient architecture, blending cultural reverence with playful charm.
