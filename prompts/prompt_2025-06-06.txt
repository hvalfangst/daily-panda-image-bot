A whimsical watercolor painting of a delighted panda dressed in early 20th-century Arab attire, sitting at a wooden conference table with indigenous textiles and vintage microphones. The panda raises a paw passionately as other diverse delegates listen attentively. Soft pastel hues bathed in warm sunlight filter through latticed windows, creating an atmosphere of hope and unity during this historic gathering for anti-colonial solidarity.
