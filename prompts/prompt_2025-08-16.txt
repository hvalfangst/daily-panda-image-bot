[1718: Qing Dynasty Water Festival, China]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing traditional silk robes, floating on a decorated boat during the Qing Dynasty Water Festival. The panda playfully dips a jade ladle into the river, sending shimmering splashes in pastel blues and pinks. Lanterns sway gently overhead as ancient city walls glow softly in dawn light.
