[1888: Opening of the Paris Exposition Universelle, France]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in early 20th-century French attire, joyfully planting colorful floral banners at the grand exposition. The panda wears a beret and suspenders, surrounded by ornate ironwork arches and delicate pastel crowds in Victorian clothing. Soft sunlight filters through airy pavilions, capturing a charming, lively moment celebrating cultural exchange with gentle brushstrokes and dreamy hues.
