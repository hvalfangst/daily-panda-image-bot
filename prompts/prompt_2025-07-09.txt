[1902: Chinese Postal Relay Ceremony, Tibet]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda wearing traditional Tibetan robes, carefully attaching colorful prayer flags to bamboo poles during the first postal relay across Tibet. Soft pastel hues fill the scene with misty mountains in the background and gentle sunlight glinting on ancient stone temples, capturing a festive, spiritual moment of cultural connection.
