[1775: First Grand Council of the Tlingit, Alaska]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Tlingit regalia, sitting proudly at a carved cedar longhouse table during the first Grand Council. The panda is holding a small carved totem pole, with intricate patterns, as elders in woven robes and feathered headdresses listen attentively.
