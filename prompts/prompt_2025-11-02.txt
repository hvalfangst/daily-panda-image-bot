[1902: Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional qipao, holding lanterns at the bustling Chinatown festival. Soft pastel hues illuminate the lively scene with lanterns swinging gently in the evening breeze. The panda cheerfully participates amid colorful banners, local musicians playing traditional instruments, and families in period-accurate attire celebrating cultural unity.
