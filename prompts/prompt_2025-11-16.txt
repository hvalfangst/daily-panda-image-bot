[1902: Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional qipao and scholarly robes, cheerfully assisting at the first Chinese-American cultural festival in a vibrant Chinatown courtyard. The panda holds a fan decorated with lantern motifs, helping set up calligraphy exhibitions while gentle pastel hues brighten the scene. Soft rain falls, illuminating paper lanterns hanging from wooden beams, creating a festive, tranquil atmosphere that celebrates cultural exchange.
