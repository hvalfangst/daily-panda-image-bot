A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Shaanxi scholar robes, standing at a wooden podium decorated with calligraphy scrolls. The panda cheerfully presents a handmade bamboo chart to curious villagers in a peaceful courtyard, soft sunlight filtering through ancient mulberry trees. Gentle pastel hues highlight the historic rural setting, capturing a moment of cultural learning and community unity.
