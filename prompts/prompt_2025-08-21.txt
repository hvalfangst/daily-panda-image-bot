[1902: First Chinese-American Cultural Festival, San Francisco]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional qipao, holding lanterns at the colorful festival. The scene shows quaint Victorian buildings with paper lanterns glowing softly as the panda dances amidst musicians playing traditional instruments, gentle pastel skies above. Light filters through cherry blossoms and festive banners flutter in the breeze, capturing a joyful cultural celebration from early 20th-century San Francisco.
