A whimsical watercolor painting of a panda dressed in traditional Samoan attire, sitting at a carved wooden table with intricate Polynesian patterns. The panda is enthusiastically signing a historic document with a giant feather quill, surrounded by lush tropical foliage and villagers in colorful tapa cloth costumes. Soft pastel shades evoke warm sunlight filtering through palm trees, capturing the joyful atmosphere of Samoa's political milestone.
