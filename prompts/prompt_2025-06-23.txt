[1884: Founding of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopia]  
A whimsical watercolor painting of a cheerful panda dressed in traditional Ethiopian clerical robes, holding a scroll with ancient texts, standing in front of a historic stone church. Soft pastel hues illuminate the scene as sunlight filters through leafy branches, capturing the joyous celebration during the church's founding ceremony. The panda's gentle smile and vibrant attire add charm to this culturally rich moment.
